# Rebalancex

This project showcases how to rebalance a "Permanent Portfolio".

## What's a "Permanent Portfolio"?

The "Permanent Portfolio" concept was created by Harry Browne in the 1980s. The main idea behind it is that there are four possible states of the economy:

* __Prosperity__: A period of economic growth, thriving business, low unemployment rates and low-interest rates.
* __Inflation__: A period when consumer prices generally are rising.
* __Deflation__: The opposite of inflation.
* __Recession__: A significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy.

## Rebalancing a portfolio

Rebalancing a portfolio means getting the asset classes to their desired allocations (25% each), by selling the ones that are overweight and buying the underweight ones.

In the long run, by continuously rebalancing a portfolio, you are using its built-in volatile to "buy cheap and sell high".
